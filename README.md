# AutomatedCabinetV3
## This project was started back in 2017 as my year 9 school project for engineering class. It's a large hand made timber cabinet with a sort of secret draw inside it, the draw is fully automated and opens and closses at will.
## I designed and built the entire electrical system which can be viewed in the links below. The electrical design went over many changes over time, originally you could activate the draw by knocking on it loudly, then it changed to a RFID scanner, and now finnaly it operates over the IoT using MQTT and node red.
## I personally use my Apple watch with the Home Assistant application to control the cabinet. The Home Assistant app also sends me notification to my Watch and phone when an event happens, here is a list of events:
## - "Safe manually opened (someone is breaking in!)", "cabinet closed", "cabinet opened", and "cabinet automatically closed."

### If you like through this projects commit history, you will find all of my MQTT server credentials, usernames passwords ect, this is because back in the day I did not bother to store credentials in seperate files, but don't worry I have changed all of my credentials since then ðŸ˜…
